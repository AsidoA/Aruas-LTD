  <h1>Aruas LTD</h1>
    <p>This project was developed using 'NodeJS' on the server side, and for displaying the data, I employed the 'EJS View Engine' due to its suitability for handling a small amount of data, ensuring quick loading times, and enhancing search engine visibility.</p>
    <p>I have chosen to store this landing page in 'OnRender' because it allows for efficient data handling and dynamic content updates, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.</p>
      <p>I utilize the 'nodeMailer' library to send emails to the company owner, containing details of prospective clients interested in the company.</p>
  <h2></h2>
  <p>This project was written for a company in the internet infrastructure field that needed a landing page capable of conveying relevant information about the company to new clients.</p>
  <p>The website is intended to serve as a business card to assist the company in consolidating new customers and establishing contact with them in order to recruit them</p>
